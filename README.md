# Purpose

This is a login form prototype built for TST. Since the instructions were to keep the project simple, additional improvements have been left out. Additionally, the instructions stated to not use any third-party packages, but I hope that was only meant for the actual component/hooks portion.

# Possible additional improvements

Some other changes that this code could benefit from:
- Tests for the `useLocalStorage` hooks
- `Input` component tests
- Mocks for the `useLocalStorage` hook in the `LoginForm` component, so that only the `LoginForm` functionality is actually tested
- Storing of "registered" users in local storage to also prevent users with the same usernames from being created
- Password length/character validation
- Use classes/ids instead of element selectors in css files. Since this project won't grow anymore, it is okay to use element selectors. In a real project, this could cause styling issues in other parts of the app.

## Thank you for the opportunity!
I hope this small project shows my focus on clean, readable code and that it leads us to another conversation. Best of luck in your search!
